    <h2>Welcome to Code Igniter</h2>

    <p>Code Igniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP.
    Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code
    from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and
    logical structure to access these libraries. Code Igniter lets you creatively focus on your project by
    minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.</p>


    <p>Please read the Introduction section of the User Guide to learn the broad concepts behind Code Igniter,
    then read the <a href="general/index.html">Getting Started</a> page.</p>
